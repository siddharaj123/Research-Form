# Research-Form
My first project implementing basic skills of HTML/CSS and Javascript Form Validation. 

The Implemented Code for this project is in researchServer -> public

The public folder contains
  1. index.html
       - This contains the html layout of the research form 
  2. researchFormValidation.js (public -> javascripts -> researchFormValidation.js)
       - This contains the javascript for the site, which is responsible for making sure the input which is being inputted into the site is correct, using simple            form validation
  3.  researchForm.css (public -> stylesheets -> researchForm.css)
      - Basic CSS stylesheet that adds style to the form
      
      
 To run this Program:
      Download the repository and go to the public folder, and type the command npx serve
